## Make window corner square on Windows 11

This script makes the window corners square on Windows 11.

When taking a screenshot of a window on Windows 11, each corners of a window are rounded.  
It looks awful to use it for documentation because the corners are filled out as backgroud color.

This script makes all toplevel window (maybe) corner from round to square.

This script is valid for Windows 11 build 22000 and later.


## Environment

- Windows 11 Pro
- Python 3.13.0
